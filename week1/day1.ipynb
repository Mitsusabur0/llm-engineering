Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

      "So a few weeks ago,\n",
      "I sat down and dissected a big alignment article by renowned RPG legend, Sean K Reynolds\n",
      ". I gave my opinions and promised to go into depth about how I think alignment should be viewed. I mentioned that one of the largest problems that our alignment system has is that we have based it off of the “real” world, which typically has one to three dominate faiths making the rules and destroying any opposition that doesn’t agree with it. In Pathfinder, that doesn’t really work. We can’t have strictly codified “rules” for what alignment means because we have hundreds, if not an infinite number, of deities that each promote its own idea of what it means to belong to a specific alignment.\n",
      "So we’re going to be looking at constructing a very vague, very basic definition of each alignment for a roleplaying game so various deities and political bodies can then take that definition and determine what it means to be Lawful Good, Chaotic Neutral, or Neutral Evil in their religion, kingdom, or community. Let’s dive in and see what we can come up with!\n",

There are many ways around this that some of you might be familiar with. For example, Selenium is a hugely popular framework that runs a browser behind the scenes, renders the page, and allows you to query it. If you have experience with Selenium, Playwright or similar, then feel free to improve the Website class to use them. In the community-contributions folder, you'll find an example Selenium solution from a student (thank you!)"
