      "Here’s a focused, self-contained build guide based on the Sword Saint Dualist concept from the Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous video. It’s a high-end, turn-based-friendly melee spellblade/“Gish” build that uses Megas Sword Saint as the core, with a splash of Duelist and a single Vivisectionist level, all under the Aeon (Aon) Mythic path for maximum crit, AC, and smear-through-spell resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Title: Sword Saint Dualist (Megas Sword Saint 9 / Duelist 10 / Vivisectionist 1) on Aeon Mythic Path\n",
      "- Role: Frontline melee damage with reliable AC, high crit potential, and strong spell-augmented attacks (Spell Strike/Spell Combat). Excellent on unfair with proper party support and turn-based play.\n",
      "- Core strengths: Very high AC (70–90+ with buffs, potentially higher with party buffs), massive crit range and damage, strong weave of spells through weapon (Force Punch main nuke), good mobility, and solid self-buffing via Arcane Pool and Mythic abilities. Works best with a tanky party to cover your spell resistance needs and crowd control.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Race, Background, and Ability Focus\n",
      "- Race: Human (extra feat at 1st level is key for this build’s prerequisites and two-class gating)\n",
      "- Background: Guard (gives light armor proficiency and generally complements a dex/AC-focused melee build)\n",
      "- Abilities (start at character creation; then level up to optimize): \n",
      "  - Dexterity: 18 (primary to hit and AC)\n",
      "  - Intelligence: 18 (drives Canny Defense AC add, Arcane Pool scaling, and many of the build’s synergy)\n",
      "  - Charisma: 8 (not a focus)\n",
      "  - Strength: leave reasonable to equipment load; you’ll stay light armor\n",
      "  - Wisdom: keep reasonable or lower; not a main driver\n",
      "  - Constitution: don’t pump too hard; you’ll rely on AC, buffs, and items to survive\n",
      "- Skills (quick picks): Mobility (required for Duelist), Athletics, Knowledge (Arcana), Knowledge (World), Perception. The rest can be allocated as you prefer.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Core Class Path (20-level plan)\n",
      "- Megas Sword Saint (Primary core; level 1–9)\n",
      "  - Key features to leverage:\n",
      "    - Canny Defense: Intelligence-based AC with your chosen weapon (the Estoc) while unarmored or in light armor\n",
      "    - Arcane Pool and Arcane Weapon: buffs cast into your weapon; you’ll emphasize Keen and Speed properties on the weapon for crit range and attack cadence\n",
      "    - Spell Strike/Spell Combat: channel touch spells through your weapon, enabling a full attack with a spell added to your action economy\n",
      "    - Perfect Strike and Perfect Critical (duelist synergy when you cross into Duelist)\n",
      "    - Enduring Blade (level 6 Arcane Pool; makes Arcane Weapon last longer)\n",
      "  - Arcane pool/Arcane Weapon focus:\n",
      "    - Arcane Accuracy (level 3): add Intelligence to attack rolls\n",
      "    - Enduring Blade (level 6): Arcane weapon duration becomes 1 minute per level\n",
      "    - Arcane Weapon choices: Keen and Speed for early crit and extra attack cadence (later you can shift to other properties as needed)\n",
      "  - Feat and ability setup (early): you need Dex + Int focus, so you’ll be working with DEX-focused feats and weapon finesse. You’ll also want Dodge for AC and to qualify for Duelist.\n",
      "- Duelist (2 levels initially for core class features)\n",
      "  - Core features: \n",
      "    - Canny Defense stacks with Megas (honest stacking; Int bonus to AC for both classes)\n",
      "    - Precise Strike: adds your Duelist level to damage with your light or estoc weapon\n",
      "    - Parry (level 2): you can parry incoming hits after a full attack; later you’ll get Counterattack, Deflect Arrows, and initiative boosts\n",
      "    - Increasing utility as you go (initiative bonuses, deflect arrows, etc.)\n",
      "    - Crippling Critical (late-game capstone of the build’s crit manipulation)\n",
      "- Vivisectionist (1 level)\n",
      "  - Purpose: a dip for a Mutagen buff and some extra sneak damage\n",
      "  - Why one level: it adds Dex bump and a touch of sneak attack damage without overcomplicating the build’s core mechanic\n",
      "- Return to Megas (finish the Megas levels)\n",
      "  - The final Megas level(s) lock in more Arcane Pool/Arcane Weapon polish and an extra AC boost; the “end-game” Megas level is less about raw spell power and more about finalizing the AC and crit synergy via Arcane weapon properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Mythic Path and Abilities\n",
      "- Path: Aeon (Aeon Trickster is a viable alternative; the video defaults to Aeon)\n",
      "  - Early Mythic ability to grab: Spell Casters Onslaught (Rank 1)\n",
      "    - Increases the attack roll bonus when you cast spells in combat (helps mitigate spell-resistance and poor hit chance late game)\n",
      "  - Mythic Armor Focus (Rank 2; Light Armor)\n",
      "    - Adds max Dex bonus to AC for light armor and adds a flat mischance to attackers (up to 15% in the long run; ramps with rank)\n",
      "  - Abundant Casting (Rank 3)\n",
      "    - Increases the total number of first/second/third level spells you can cast, matching Megas’ spell slots\n",
      "  - Improved Critical (Estoc) (Rank 4)\n",
      "    - Increases the critical threat range for your estoc\n",
      "  - Leading Strike (Rank 5)\n",
      "    - Bolsters party damage after you strike\n",
      "  - Weapon Focus (Estoc) (Rank 6)\n",
      "    - Doubles your attack roll bonus with Estoc (synergizes with previous Weapon Finesse and Archane Pool)\n",
      "  - Unrelenting Assault (Rank 7)\n",
      "    - Stacks with multiple attacks to boost damage over time\n",
      "  - Spell Penetration Mythic (Rank 8)\n",
      "    - Helps your spells pierce spell resistance more reliably (essential late-game)\n",
      "  - Thundering Blows (Rank 9)\n",
      "    - Adds extra on-hit power\n",
      "  - Rank 10: Flexible choice (you can tailor to taste)\n",
      "- Aon-specific options (Bane and Enforcing Gaze)\n",
      "  - Aon Bane: activates multiple times per day and grants your weapon Bane quality against chosen targets; adds Master Level checks against spell resistance\n",
      "  - Enforcing Gaze: choose attack-role boosts first; other effects can be added later (useful for hit chance and stacking buffs)\n",
      "- Note: Trickster is a solid alternative for crit synergy and sneak attack scaling, but Aeon is the recommended path in the video for the strongest overall kit with this combo.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Feats and Leveling Timeline (PF1-style progression)\n",
      "The video’s plan is roughly: Megas up to 8, then 2 levels of Duelist, 1 level of Vivisectionist, then the final Megas, finishing with Duelist to cap at 10 levels overall for Duelist and 9 for Megas. A cleaned, practical outline:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Level 1 (Megas): Weapon Finesse, Dodge, Estoc (Estoc chosen as weapon gives Weapon Focus automatically); start Shield and touch-range spells (Shield, Grease, Magic Missile)\n",
      "- Level 2–3 (Megas): Fencing Grace (level 3), Arcane Pool access\n",
      "- Level 4–5 (Megas): Move toward Arcane Accuracy (level 3), Enduring Blade (level 6)\n",
      "- Level 5 (Duelist, first level): Combat Mobility (prereq for Duelist), Light Armor Focus (bonus feat; Mythic belt for light armor)\n",
      "- Level 6–7 (Duelist): Weapon Specialization (Estoc)\n",
      "- Level 8–9 (Duelist): Blind Fight (or Piranha Strike as an alternative on lower difficulties)\n",
      "- Level 10 (Duelist): Improved Critical (Estoc)\n",
      "- Level 11 (Duelist): Critical Focus\n",
      "- Level 12 (Duelist): Crippling Critical (late-game target; optional trade-off with Piranha Strike or other crit feats)\n",
      "- Level 13 (Duelist): Additional synergy feats (e.g., Spell Penetration for late-game spell success)\n",
      "- Level 14–15 (Duelist): Crippling Critical or additional crit-focused feats; you can swap for Piranha Strike if you prefer more raw damage in exchange for hit chance\n",
      "- Level 16–18 (Duelist): Continue stacking crit-focused and AC/defense feats\n",
      "- Level 19 (Duelist): Spell Penetration (final push for late-game)\n",
      "- Level 20 (Duelist): Endgame choices; Thundering Blows or other last feats depending on playstyle\n",
      "\n",
      "Important note on levels: The video emphasizes you want a huge pool of AC and heavy crit capability. The exact split can be tuned a bit, but the core idea is: a strong Megas base with Arcane Power, plus Duellist feats that push your crit range and damage while keeping your AC absurdly high.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Gear and Itemization (the big-ticket items)\n",
      "Aim for absolute +DEX/+INT synergy, and an Estoc that scales with your crit and AC buffs.\n",
      "- Weapon progression (Estoc):\n",
      "  - Early: Finney’s talking weapon (Estoc) +1 (found in Act 1; guarantees +1 weapon)\n",
      "  - Act 1–3: Finny the Talking Weapon upgrades into Crippling Kiss (Estoc +3) after Green Gates\n",
      "  - Act 4 onward: Night Flash (Estoc +5; Speed enchantment; a rare +5 Estoc purchased from the Demon area via a slave market questline)\n",
      "  - Final weapon is Night Flash for the rest of the game\n",
      "- Armor and armor-like protections:\n",
      "  - Light armor for the base AC; Ice Guard in Kabran area (fortification + melee-chunk damage on hit)\n",
      "  - Bracers: Lucky Bracers early; Bracers of Slaughter later (armor-ignoring damage with +3d10 Force; note that stacking with armor needs careful accounting; heavy emphasis on your AC)\n",
      "  - Boots: Ronx Sacrifice — Dex +8, AC boost, haste-inspired triggers; don’t forget to repair with the Storyteller to keep it working\n",
      "  - War Kilts of Sarin Ray (or equivalent) — +2 Natural Armor to help AC without stacking with Dex\n",
      "  - Cloak: White Wind’s Cloak ( Ivory Sanctum, optional puzzle reward) — parry buff, extra damage to precise strike; Sacred Nimbus defensive buff\n",
      "  - Head: Headband of Vast Intelligence (+6 INT, boosts AC via Kenny Defense and improves Canny Defense)\n",
      "  - Neck: Alexia’s Magnifying Amulet — Natural Armor necklace; Act 4 gives +2 to highest ability (Dex or Int), stacking nicely\n",
      "  - Belt: Start with Dex belt; later swap to more powerful options\n",
      "  - Other: Manuals to permanently increase stats (INT +2; DEX +2 per book) found in PF: Wrath (P’Fall puzzle for INT, Midnight Fane for DEX). In the Dance of Masks DLC, a secret item grants +4 to all ability scores (this overrides earlier manuals if you haven’t used them yet)\n",
      "- Utility items:\n",
      "  - White Wind’s Cloak (as mentioned)\n",
      "  - Gnawing Magic Headgear (via Ka’s quest; +INT, +GRANT to overcoming spell resistance but with a trade-off debuff)\n",
      "- Spells and scrolls:\n",
      "  - Focus on Force Punch (Level 3 spell) as your main melee-burst; use Shield, Grease, Magic Missile early\n",
      "  - Displacement, Haste (level 2) as standard buffs\n",
      "  - Misdirection-like buffs and Aon-specific spells (Perfect Prediction; Relativity (Haste + Slow on enemies); Protective buffs)\n",
      "  - The Aeon spellbook (Bane, Enforcing Gaze); other spells like Relativity and Archon Auras; you’ll be using Swift actions to stack quick buffs\n",
      "- Other items:\n",
      "  - If you haven’t completed the DLC, the secret +4 to all stats item is a dream if you’re willing to grind. It’s not stacking with the earlier manuals, but it’s a major power bump.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Spells for the Megas Sword Saint\n",
      "- Early game: Shield, Magic Missile, Grease\n",
      "- Mid game: Force Punch (your main go-to attack spell to add to your weapon via Spell Strike); Haste and Misdirection-type buffs; Displacement\n",
      "- Late game (Aeon & endgame): Perfect Prediction (AC boost), Relativity (haste effect on you; slow on surrounding enemies), Protection from Arrows (communal), Death Swords; Edicts (Fortress-like buffs to damage / immunity windows)\n",
      "- Important synergy: Force Punch is your main “save-the-day” attack. On unfair, fortitude saves can push some enemies away; use it intelligently based on the fight and whether you can overpower spell resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Combat Tactics and Playstyle\n",
      "- Turn-based recommended: The build relies on toggling a lot of active buffs; turn-based makes it way more reliable.\n",
      "- Buff stacking order (typical):\n",
      "  - Buff self with Aeon/Affinity buffs (Spell Casters Onslaught, Enforcing Gaze attack role boosts)\n",
      "  - Activate Arcane Weapon (Keen/Speed) and Arcane Accuracy\n",
      "  - Turn on Precise Strike, Perfect Strike, and Crippling Critical when you need to punch through tough targets\n",
      "  - If you’re under heavy debuff or you’re facing a high-AC boss, rely on Aon Bane to boost hit chances and damage\n",
      "- Combat cadence:\n",
      "  - You’ll likely start with a strong melee swing that uses your enhanced attack and crit range\n",
      "  - If you can, push your first big hit with a Force Punch to spread knockback and force saved attacks, while your party follows with heavy hits\n",
      "  - Toggle off Shield during bursts if you need more reliable precise strike damage (the shield can cancel Precise Strike for some players)\n",
      "  - Use Arcane Weapon’s Haste property to gain an extra attack, ensuring you stay in the top kill windows\n",
      "- Team synergy:\n",
      "  - Your insane AC protects your team; your party should have strong offense and CC to manage enemies while you set up for big crits\n",
      "  - The Aeon path’s Bane/Enforcing Gaze buffs help keep enemies in your wheelhouse\n",
      "\n",
      "8) Strengths and Limitations\n",
      "- Strengths:\n",
      "  - Extremely high AC (70–90+ with buffs; higher with party help)\n",
      "  - Very strong single-target DPS via crits and Force Punch combos\n",
      "  - Great damage consistency with Arcane Pool, Arcane Weapon, and the Megas/Duelist synergy\n",
      "  - Excellent in late-game, especially on Unfair, with proper gear and mythic buffs\n",
      "- Limitations:\n",
      "  - Very gear- and buff-dependent; requires a lot of toggling and micro-management\n",
      "  - Not beginner-friendly; better with turn-based control and a patient playstyle\n",
      "  - Requires careful planning to maximize Can-n Defense (INT-based AC) and avoid Shield-precision conflicts\n",
      "  - Some named feats in the roadmap can be non-intuitive; you may swap for Piranha Strike or other options if you prefer.\n",
      "\n",
      "9) Quick Reference Summary (for a grab-and-go)\n",
